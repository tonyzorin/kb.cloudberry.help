{% hint style="warning" %}
If, as a result of time synchronization, your computer received "_A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host failed to respond_", you should check that UDP port 123 allowed in NAT rules.
{% endhint %}
